QuoteMaker.exe allows you to automatically create a functional addon for SoundDeliver, WoWQuote, KQuote

	--Run it
	--Enter a name like "QuoteMediaBarlow"
	--Enter an id like "bar"
	--Choose a folder containing .mp3 files
	--In the same folder a complete QuoteMedia Addon for WoWQuote2 will be generated
	--Upload it or share it with your friends
	
	--tags will be automatically generated => It's considered music if the sound file is longer than 15 seconds else it's a sound
	--name will be generated by the file name, you can rename the file however you want it to appear in the addon
	--duration will be automatically generated... HURRAY!

I guarantee you this file is not more than a minimal Interface,
